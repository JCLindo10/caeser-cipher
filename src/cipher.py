    This module contains the functions to encrypt and decrypt a message using the
    well-known encryption algorithm called the caeser cipher.

    encrypt - takes a shift value and a file name and encrypts the file using the
                caeser cipher algorithm.

    decrypt - If a shift value is provided, the file is decrypted using that shift
                value. If no shift value is provided, the file is decrypted using
                all possible shift values, and the output is check against a 
                dictionary of words. The most likely shift value is then used to
                decrypt the file.
